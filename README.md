# tandemrace

This is the project repository for our group in the course CIVIL-459 Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles at EPFL. The goal of the project is to use deep learning methods to train a robot to participate in a human-robot tandem race at EPFL. This ReadMe will update with more information as we work thorugh the milestones in the course.
